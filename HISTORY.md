## v0.2.2 - 2012-03-27

 * Maven repo changes.

## v0.2.1 - 2012-03-26

 * Weight information of an instance is attached as metadata when converting to a map.

## v0.2.0 - 2012-02-06

 * Upgraded to clojure 1.3.

## v0.1.5 - 2012-01-23

 * MongoDB support was removed (the original author has never
 communicated with me and I have no intention on maintaining that
 functionality)

### New Features
 * adds attribute-value-fn helper fn

### Bug Fixes
  * fixes bug in add-attribute filter, name can now be specified.

## v0.1.4 - 2011-12-14

### New Features
  * new filter wrappers: remove-range, remove-percentage
  * new helpers: split-dataset, do-split-dataset, take-dataset,
                 randomize-dataset!, randomize-dataset, map-fast-vec


## v0.1.3 - 2011-10-07

### New Features
  * added new attribute selection namespace


## v0.1.2 - 2011-06-14

### New Features
  * added `dataset-weights` function

### Bug Fixes
  * Does not create new `ClojureInstances` with `dataset-seq`, just uses weka's built in enumerator.

## v0.1.1 - 2011-06-14

### New Features
  * added FastRandomForests which are more space and time efficient that Weka's default implementation.

### Bug Fixes
  * More typehinting for filter creation.

## v0.1.0 - 2011-04-11

### New Features
  * New filter wrappers added: `RemoveUseless` as `:remove-useless`, `Add` as `:add-attribute`
  * New classifier wrappers added: `PaceRegression`, `RandomForest`, M5P Trees and boosted stumps (`LogitBoost`), `AdditiveRegression`, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, `RotationForest`, `SPegasos`
  * Increased the number of options that can be specified for classifiers.
  * Adds `:clj-streamable` and `:clj-batch` filters which allow for custom
  functions to be provided for filtering the dataset.
  * More idiomatic way and using/applying filters that allows threading.
  * Attribute names can now be specified in the filters and other accessor functions instead of requiring the columns index.
  * New utility functions: `into-fast-vec, dataset-replace-attribute, dataset-class-values, dataset-nominal?, make-apply-filters, classifer-copy-and-train, keyword-name, headers-only, dataset-class-name, attribute-labels-as-strings, dataset-name`
  * Speed improvement in `dataset-as-maps`

### Bug Fixes
  * `is-dataset?` reports falses correctly now.
  * A large ammount of type hinting was added to many areas where it was slowing down real use-cases.
  * Loading and saving instances functions now work with streams (not just files or file names).
  * `nil` values are allowed in datasets (represented as `NaN`s in weka)
